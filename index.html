    // now here is the problem!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
      const team2 = players.slice();
      console.log(team2); // other way to write it is const team3 = [].concat(players);
    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    // const captain = person;
    // captain.number = 99; // is not good cuz it will give the assigment to the original object
    // how do we take a copy instead?
     // we use the method object.asssing

     const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99});
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
     const cap3 = {...person}; // spreading objects
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
